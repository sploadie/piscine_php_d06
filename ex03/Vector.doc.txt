<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Vectors can represent directions or travel.
For "right hand" 3D orientation in 3D.
Homogeneous coordinate/vector system
our vectors, but this time, the w component and will always be worth 0.0 consider-
SOE as any component of the vector in the calculations, as well as x,
y or z.
A vector is represented by the following features:
• magnitude x (default: 0.0)
• magnitude y (default: 0.0)
• magnitude z (default: 0.0)
• w-coordinate (default: 1.0)

The Vector class is only slightly more complex than the Vertex class. Some methods
ask some very simple calculations that are normally dealt in second in high school.

• Provides read-only functions for all four attributes.

• The class constructor expects an array. Expected keys are the following:
	'Dest':	destination vertex of the vector	(mandatory)
	'Orig':	vector's origin vertex				(optional)

• Static boolean 'verbose' controls the displays associated with
	the use of the class (default is FALSE).
• If 'verbose' is true, then the builder and destructor of the class will produce an output.
• '__toString' function allows use of Vertex as string.
• 'doc' function returns the content of the documentation.
• Methods of Vector class never modify the current instance.
• Offers the following public methods:
	float magnitude (): returns the length (or "Standard") of the vector.
	Vector normalize (): returns the normalized vector. If the vector is already normalized, returns a fresh copy of the vector.
	Vector add (Vector $rhs): returns the vector sum of two vectors.
	Vector sub (Vector $rhs): returns the difference vector of the two vectors.
	Vector opposite (): returns the opposite vector.
	Vector scalarProduct ($k) returns the product of the vector with a scalar.
	float dotProduct (Vector $rhs): returns the dot product of two vectors.
	float cos (Vector $rhs): returns the cosine of the angle between two vectors.
	Vector CrossProduct (Vector $rhs): Returns the cross product of two vectors (Right hand!)
